# Netflix-Movies-Recommendation-System

Netflix Movies Recommendation System
This project explores and analyzes the Netflix Titles Dataset, which contains detailed metadata about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights into Netflix's content strategy over the years and visualize trends based on content type, release years, country of production, genres, and cast/directors.

By cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data, we uncover key patterns in the streaming platformâ€™s library, identify the most common genres, top contributing countries, and content release trends. This project is ideal for demonstrating data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization skills using Python.
